# Phase 4: Signing Integration - Implementation Plan

## Current Status

- ✅ Tangem SDK dependency is properly integrated (v3.8.0)
- ✅ Basic TangemController structure is in place
- ✅ UI integration is complete
- ✅ Build is successful

## What I've Discovered About Tangem SDK v3.8.0

### TangemSdk Constructor Requirements

The `TangemSdk` class requires these parameters:

- `reader`: NFC reader for communication
- `viewDelegate`: UI delegate for user interactions
- `secureStorage`: Secure storage implementation
- `wordlist`: Wordlist for mnemonic operations

### Key Challenges Identified

1. **API Structure**: The Tangem SDK v3.8.0 has a different API structure than expected
2. **Initialization Complexity**: Requires multiple components to be properly initialized
3. **Documentation Gap**: Limited documentation available for v3.8.0 API

## Implementation Strategy

### Step 1: Research and Understand SDK Structure

- [ ] Find proper Tangem SDK documentation or examples
- [ ] Understand the required components (reader, viewDelegate, etc.)
- [ ] Identify the correct classes for scanning, deriving, and signing

### Step 2: Create Tangem SDK Wrapper

- [ ] Create proper initialization of TangemSdk
- [ ] Implement NFC reader integration
- [ ] Create view delegate for UI interactions
- [ ] Set up secure storage

### Step 3: Implement Core Functionality

- [ ] Card scanning functionality
- [ ] Wallet derivation for Ethereum addresses
- [ ] Hash signing for transactions
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback

### Step 4: Create Signing ViewModels

- [ ] TangemSignViewModel (similar to LedgerSignViewModel)
- [ ] TangemSignDialog (similar to LedgerSignDialog)
- [ ] Integration with existing signing flow

### Step 5: Update Navigation and UI

- [ ] Add Tangem signing navigation
- [ ] Update OwnerListViewModel to handle Tangem signing
- [ ] Update TxReviewViewModel to support Tangem

### Step 6: Testing and Validation

- [ ] Test with placeholder implementations
- [ ] Validate integration with existing signing flow
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling

## Current Approach: Incremental Implementation

Since the Tangem SDK API is complex and requires careful setup, I'll implement this incrementally:

1. **Keep existing placeholder implementations** for now
2. **Research and understand the SDK** properly
3. **Implement step by step** with proper testing
4. **Ensure compatibility** with existing signing patterns

## Next Steps

1. Research Tangem SDK v3.8.0 documentation
2. Create proper SDK initialization
3. Implement basic card scanning
4. Add wallet derivation
5. Implement transaction signing
6. Integrate with existing signing flow

## Risk Mitigation

- **Incremental approach**: Implement one feature at a time
- **Fallback to placeholders**: Keep working implementations as fallbacks
- **Thorough testing**: Test each step before proceeding
- **Documentation**: Document findings and implementation details

This cautious approach ensures we build a robust, working implementation while understanding the SDK properly.
